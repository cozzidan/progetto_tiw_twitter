<b>Description</b> <br>
This university project is a web application that manages a messaging stream similar to Twitter. Users can register and login through a public webpage.

The registration process validates email syntax and ensures password matching. Messages are stored in a database with attributes like text, date, and the user who posted them. Images can be included with messages and are stored on the server's file system.

Users can create discussion threads and associate messages with them. Threads have titles, creator names, creation dates, and can contain multiple messages. Other users can comment on thread messages, including their usernames.

The dashboard displays lists of threads created by the user and others, sorted by creation date. Clicking on a thread opens a page showing its messages. Navigation commands allow users to view previous and next messages if a thread has more than ten.

The thread page includes a comment form. Submitting a comment refreshes the page with updated data. Users can return to the home page or log out.

<b>Note</b> <br>
This project is a university assignment and is not a fully functional real-world application.
